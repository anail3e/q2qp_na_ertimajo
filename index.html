                Creation of the Office of the Developmental Disabilities Ombuds</h2>
            <p>DRW applied for and was awarded the contract to operate the Office of the Developmental Disabilities Ombuds. 
                 Work started by establishing offices for the Ombuds across the state in Seattle, Spokane and Olympia.  
                 Staff were hired and trained.  Advisory Committee members were recruited, representing diversity across the 3 
                 service regions and having a supermajority of Individuals with Developmental Disabilities.  Finally, the protocols
                  for the DD Ombuds were established and the website launched.</p>

            <p>Rooted in Rights releases “Bottom Dollars,” a 55 minute original documentary.  Bottom Dollars exposes the exploitation 
                of nearly 250,000 people with disabilities in the U.S. that are legally being paid less than the minimum wage, on average,
                 less than $2 an hour.  The documentary calls for the phase out of the unfair practice of sub-minimum wages and sheltered
                  workshops, and offers solutions for fair wages and inclusive employment.</p>

        <h2>Disability Rights Washington provides free services to people with disabilities.</h2>
        <p>We are a private non-profit organization that protects the rights of people with disabilities statewide. Our mission is to
             advance the dignity, equality, and self-determination of people with disabilities. We pursue justice on matters related to
              human and legal rights. We focus our legal resources on systemic cases which will improve service systems for people with disabilities. We exist because society and service systems are not always fair or responsive to people with disabilities. 
              We work for change in policies, laws, and systems that promote: Disability Rights Washington is governed by a Board of Directors, with help from our Advisory Councils. 
              These groups are made up of people with disabilities, family members, and others who have an interest in disability rights.
